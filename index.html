<p>Or This</p>

<pre>
my head throbs in the mornings loud so in fifteen
minute intervals I masturbate to whores
moaning my tooth aches from acid I am a hurt
smile god was good I did laughing gas on sundays and
and all ass and breast because sunday noon
on I read arcade critics at a reflective age at least I'm a good drunk with bad
meter myself sick spiteful unpleasant and remember I don't try to help names
slip but it was liza or iris or eurydice said I had this special way with
words because I said we were spring
bears I showed her my poems she did a real
laugh because they weren't disgusting like me or her or this
bed I said my wife was everything the girl was night deep I looked
back at her halfdeadeyes and saw
myself doomed because every dragon needs a princess and all dragons are just
princesses so I sang my poetry to her going body as a taxi driver
poet in an underworld river singing odes for my wife
to the
dead
